	"abstract" : "At CAR:GO, we asked ourselves, What if no one needed to have a car? What if getting around town could be as easy as touching a button? If you are a busy executive, needing to get from one meeting to another all day long, or if you just want to meet people around town but taxis are too expensive, or if you just need to get across town in a hurry, CAR:GO is there to help. Click and go. CAR:GO has been designed to be fast, reliable, and easy. Not to mention good value! The app you install on your phone allows our drivers to find you fast and get you where you want to go. And because of our exclusive pre-payment system, the ride is already paid by the time you get there. We came up with CAR:GO, a quick, efficient way to get from A to B in Belgrade without the hassle of the bus, hailing a taxi, or circling for hours to park. And with the introduction of Ride Sharing, CAR:GO brings even more convenience and savings!Nothing easier.We use compact cars because they are zippy and can get around obstacles fast. They are more efficient too – so they cost less! And we use elite cars as well, since sometimes you want a little more comfort and class.CAR:GO is the first ride-sharing service in Belgrade, looking to expand regionally and globally.",
